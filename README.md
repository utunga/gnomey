Playing with Node, Cloud9, Yammer, CoffeeScript
====================================

Doing all these things at the same time for the first time
(this won't end well ;-)

Actually in the end CoffeeScript and Cloud9 were both deemed 'cool but not needed'

*NOTE:*
=====

To get started you need to get an access token for your yammer server.
(See config.js for more details...)
